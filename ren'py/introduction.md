# Game development using Ren'Py

## A Python x Game Development study groups collaboration 

We will be making a simple interactive game or *visual novel* using a Python engine called Ren'Py. This is a collaboration between the WWCode Manila Python :snake:, and Game Development :video_game: â€‹Study Groups! 

**Game development** with Python is under one of our advanced topics. While a working knowledge of Python is needed in order to carry out some of the exercises in this study guide, Ren'Py also has its own syntax. We'll be learning and applying these throughout this study session.



# What is Ren'Py

<img src= "https://www.renpy.org/static/index-logo.png" align="right"/>Ren'Py is a game engine used to make visual novels - interactive stories with words, sounds, and often with choose-your-own-ending storyline. It has its own simple scripting language, and since it's based on Python, you can also leverage your coding skills in order to make more complex games.
