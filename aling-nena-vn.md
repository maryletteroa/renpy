# Aling Nena's visual novel

We'll be going through a simple interactive game featuring Aling Nena and her *apo* (grandchild). You may have met Aling Nena during one of our basic Python study groups. 

## Plotline

This game follows the adventure of the player (you!) as Aling Nena's grandchild who have visited her in the province one summer vacation. You'll be interacting with many **characters**:

- Aling Nena, your grandmother
- Lita and Boy, your friends 
- Bert and Tasya, Aling Nena's *suki* (loyal customers) in her *sari-sari* store (a small grocery store)

The story takes places in various **scenes**:

- Inside Aling Nena's house
- Outside in the streets
- In Aling Nena's store
- The beach

Along the way, you'll have to decide what your character will do next by selecting answers in a **menu** screen. Depending on  your answers along the branching storyline, you'll either encounter a *good ending* or a *bad ending*. 

## Materials

The materials for this Ren'Py game tutorial are [here](http://bit.ly/wwcodemanila-renpy). These include: 

- [ ] code for the game
- [ ] assets (images) for the game 

Feel free to play this game and/or look at the codes `script.rpy` and `batobato.rpy` to familiarize your self with the gameplay as well as how the code is structured.

!> If you haven't done so already, create a new Ren'Py game from the launcher called `Aling Nena VN` or whatever title you want to put in. Make sure you set the screen size to 1980 px by 720 px. 

## Scripts 

As mentioned earlier, Ren'Py creates default scripts with example codes and values when a new game is created:

- `script.rpy` - contains the main dialogue and scenes in our game. This is the file we'll be working with the most in order to create our interactive novel.
- `options.rpy` - here, we can specify some details about the game e.g. the title that will be shown in the main screen and the game version
- `gui.rpy` - this is where we can change how the game will look like including accent colors, fonts, and menu borders.
- `screens.rpy` - here we can set other properties of the game e.g. the positions of the menus and labels in each screen.

In general, Ren'Py reads all `.rpy` scripts as one so we can actually split multiple parts of the game's narration into different `.rpy` files or just write all in a single file.

# Exercise

Open the script `script.rpy`. Clear everything from this file as we will be replacing the default story with our own story.
